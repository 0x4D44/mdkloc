# Coverage Improvement Program — Final Summary

Date: 2025-10-31

## Overview
- Objective: Raise production line coverage with `cargo-llvm-cov` while keeping code quality high and behavior stable.
- Approach: Add targeted integration tests (via the CLI) that exercise difficult parsing and traversal paths; make surgical, no-op refactors to reduce brace/argument-only uncovered lines; tighten CI coverage gates.
- Policy: Exclude inline unit test module (`src/tests_included.rs`) from coverage denominator to focus metrics on production paths.

## Final Metrics (cargo-llvm-cov)
- Lines: 99.02%
- Regions: 95.79%
- Functions: 97.27%

Command used:
```
cargo llvm-cov --summary-only --ignore-filename-regex 'src/tests_included.rs$'
```

Toolchain summary:
- rustc 1.90.0
- cargo 1.90.0
- cargo-llvm-cov 0.6.21

## CI Gates (Current)
- Lines ≥ 98%
- Regions ≥ 95%
- Functions ≥ 96%

Workflow step (excerpt):
```
cargo llvm-cov --summary-only \
  --ignore-filename-regex 'src/tests_included.rs$' \
  --fail-under-lines 98 \
  --fail-under-regions 95 \
  --fail-under-functions 96
```

## Timeline of Coverage Gains (selected checkpoints)
- Baseline this phase: ~97.0% lines
- After first edge-suite (error paths, symlinks, JSX/JS/PHP/Pascal/Mustache/IPLAN/XML): 97.21% → 97.31%
- After JavaScript/JSX close/tail permutations + dotfiles totals: 97.83% → 98.08% → 98.19%
- After scan traversal micro-tests and small refactors (Rust/Python/IPLAN/C-style/Javascript paths): 98.35% → 98.51%
- Final small scan refactor (helper context + symlink handler): 99.02% lines

## Tests Added (key files)
- `tests/cli_regions_edges.rs` — Mixed-language close-with-trailing-code cases; permission-denied file; symlink metadata failure; single-file root scan.
- `tests/cli_regions_edges_more.rs` — Multi-line “open on this line, close on next” permutations (C/C++/JS/JSX/PHP/Pascal/PS1/XML).
- `tests/cli_regions_edges_targeted.rs` — Precision cases for break/continue paths; DCL first-non-empty detection; IPLAN block-open without same-line close.
- `tests/cli_totals_dotfiles.rs` — Shell dotfiles + special names (Makefile, CMakeLists.txt, Dockerfile) via totals.
- `tests/cli_smoke.rs` — Symlinked directories/files; symlink to external file; injected failures for `read_dir` and `file_type`; combined flags and filters.

Notes
- New tests assert via CLI output (“Totals by language”) and targeted substrings for errors/warnings to avoid brittle full-string matches.

## Code Changes (surgical, behavior-neutral)
Parsing
- Rust/JS/JSX/PHP/Mustache/Pascal: unified “close + trailing” handling by computing close index once and checking trailing slice; removed nested `if let Some(..)` wrappers.
- Pascal: replaced `.last()` on double-ended iterators with `.rsplit(..).next()` per clippy.
- Python: hoisted trailing-slice checks to locals (no logic change).

Traversal
- Introduced small internal processing context `ProcCtx` and helper `process_entry_file` to shorten repeated multi-arg calls to `process_file`.
- Added `handle_symlink` helper to encapsulate symlink target behavior and error reporting.
- Restored early-return semantics for file-root scanning to match existing unit expectations.

Linting & Formatting
- `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` and `cargo fmt` clean throughout.

## Rationale for Refactors
- llvm-cov occasionally counts brace-only or argument-only lines as DA=0 even when the path executes. Hoisting to local bindings and collapsing nested option checks reduces these artifacts without changing logic.

## Reproduction (local)
1) Install cargo-llvm-cov (if needed):
```
cargo install cargo-llvm-cov
```
2) Run the standard repository checks:
```
cargo fmt
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
cargo test
```
3) Coverage summary (production-only lines):
```
cargo llvm-cov --summary-only --ignore-filename-regex 'src/tests_included.rs$'
```
4) Optional detailed outputs:
```
cargo llvm-cov --lcov --output-path coverage.lcov --ignore-filename-regex 'src/tests_included.rs$'
cargo llvm-cov --text --output-path textcov.txt --ignore-filename-regex 'src/tests_included.rs$'
```

## Risk & Validation
- Scope-limited edits; no public CLI changes.
- Behavior validated by comprehensive integration tests across languages and traversal scenarios.
- CI enforces minimum coverage thresholds to prevent regressions.

## Future Work (optional)
- If desired, raise CI line gate to ≥99% (current headroom supports it) and bump function gate to ≥97%.
- Add one or two micro-fixtures for exotic traversal shapes if we want higher region coverage (≥96%).
