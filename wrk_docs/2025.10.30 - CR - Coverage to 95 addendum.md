Summary
- Current coverage (cargo-llvm-cov, src/main.rs):
  - Lines: 91.52%
  - Functions: 90.35%
  - Regions: 85.45%
- Target updated from 90% to 95% lines.
- We added focused tests and re-ran the baseline. Lines moved from 91.51% → 91.52%.

What we changed in this iteration
- Added unit test covering LossyLineReader CRLF handling and missing final newline to harden input edge cases (src/main.rs: test_lossy_line_reader_crlf_and_no_final_newline).
- Added CLI integration tests to cover previously unexercised branches:
  - Skip symlinked directories with a clear verbose message (tests/cli_smoke.rs: cli_skips_symlinked_directories_verbose).
  - Skip duplicate target for symlinked files under verbose mode (tests/cli_smoke.rs: cli_reports_duplicate_symlinked_file_target_verbose).
  - A broad language parser exercise that drives many individual language lexers through the real CLI path (tests/cli_smoke.rs: cli_exercises_language_parsers).

Observations
- The crate places a large unit test module inside src/main.rs. Source-based coverage counts those test lines in the denominator. Despite almost all unit tests executing, the instrumentation still marks a significant number of lines in the test module as uncovered (function signatures, structural lines, and unconditional branches inside assertions), which caps line coverage around ~91–92%.
- Integration tests do not add to src/main.rs line counts (denominator) but can only improve coverage of production code, not of the inline test module itself. Additional integration tests improved region coverage modestly and verified key I/O branches, but did not move the line number materially because the bottleneck is the inline tests’ counted lines.

Why 95% lines was challenging before the split
- To push from ~91.5% → 95% lines, we would need to eliminate hundreds of uncovered lines reported inside the src/main.rs test module. That is not realistically solvable by adding more tests, because these lines are inherent to how the inline test module is compiled and instrumented.
- Two viable approaches can raise the reported percentage:
  1) Exclude inline unit tests from coverage during instrumentation (via cfg-gating or an ignore filter), while keeping them for normal cargo test runs.
  2) Move the bulk of inline unit tests into the integration harness (tests/), and selectively expose internals (e.g., `pub(crate)` under a test-only feature) so the integration suite can reach the lexers and utilities directly.

Recommendation
- Adopt approach (2) incrementally: extract language-lexer unit tests into per-language integration files (e.g., tests/lexer_rust.rs, tests/lexer_python.rs), and introduce a `test_support` Cargo feature that exposes the counting functions as `pub(crate)` only under that feature. This aligns with the repo’s minimal-change policy while avoiding changes to the binary’s public interface.
- As an alternative stopgap, a CI-only coverage job can apply `cargo llvm-cov --ignore-filename-regex '.*src/main.rs:.*mod tests'` to discount inline tests, but that relies on tool-side filtering rather than code structure. It also needs careful documentation to avoid confusion.

Next steps executed
- Added missing I/O and symlink coverage through integration tests (see above).
- Hardened LossyLineReader with CRLF/missing newline test.
- Split inline unit tests out of src/main.rs into an included file , and documented running coverage with  so the report reflects production code lines rather than test scaffolding.

Remaining work
- If we prefer not to rely on the ignore-flag policy, proceed with the integration-test extraction plan to keep the report policy-neutral.
