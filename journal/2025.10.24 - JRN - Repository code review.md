# Task Journal â€“ Repository Code Review

**Date**: 2025-10-24  
**Task**: Full mdkloc repository code review

## Activities
- Surveyed project layout (`src/main.rs`, `tests/cli_smoke.rs`, docs) and noted existing review history.
- Audited core implementation:
  - Flagged root-level ignore handling that skips explicitly requested directories.
  - Identified Shell dotfiles being routed through the generic counter despite language detection.
  - Confirmed other notable behaviors (performance reporting, failure-injection hooks, language dispatch).
- Reviewed documentation and dependencies, highlighting mismatches (parallelization claim, unused `unicode-normalization` crate).
- Authored `docs/2025.10.24 - CR - Repository review.md` summarizing findings, severities, and suggestions.
- Attempted `cargo test`; run halted when the sandbox could not reach `static.crates.io`.
- Re-reviewed the report to clarify root-ignore and shell-dotfile fixes and refreshed the document with concrete remediation steps.
- Added README version-drift note to the report after confirming the mismatch between `Cargo.toml` (v2.3.0) and the documentation header (v2.0.0).
- Authored `docs/2025.10.24 - REQS - Report remediation plan.md` outlining staged remediation tasks derived from the review findings.
- Produced a full repository audit in `docs/2025.10.24 - CR - Full repository audit.md`, capturing critical correctness bugs, maintainability gaps, and positive coverage notes.
- Re-reviewed the full audit, tightened severity narratives, added concrete fix approaches, and saved the updated report.
- Ran another pass on the audit to correct the root-ignore reproduction steps (now explicitly uses a directory named `target`) and reconfirmed all recommendations.
- Authored `docs/2025.10.24 - PLAN - Audit remediation roadmap.md`, translating the audit findings into a staged execution plan.

## Follow-ups
- Implement fixes for the ignore handling and shell dotfile routing.
- Update README and prune unused dependencies once behavior aligns.
- Re-run full test suite when network access (or vendored dependencies) is available.
