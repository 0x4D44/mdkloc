# Task Journal - Repository Code Review

**Date**: 2025-10-25  
**Task**: Perform a comprehensive code review of mdkloc per the latest guidance.

## Actions
- Re-read the existing docs in `docs/` and prior journals to understand previously recorded issues and expectations.
- Inspected `src/main.rs`, `tests/cli_smoke.rs`, `Cargo.toml`, and `readme.md` for correctness, architecture, and documentation drift.
- Verified two regressions locally:
  - `cargo run -- tmp-review/target --non-recursive` → confirmed that explicitly requesting a directory named `target` yields zero files processed.
  - `cargo run -- tmp-review/dotfiles --non-recursive --verbose` → observed `.bashrc` comment lines being counted as code.
- Captured all findings, severities, repro steps, and recommendations in `docs/2025.10.25 - CR - Repository review.md`.

## Notes
- The ignore logic, shell dotfile handling, and `--max-entries` semantics remain unresolved compared to the 2025-10-24 reports and now have fresh repro evidence.
- Next pass should prioritize landing fixes + regression tests for the critical/important items before tackling the structural refactor.

## Update – Report Re-review
- Re-ran the earlier reproduction commands plus `cargo run -- tmp-review/fanout --max-entries 1` to confirm directories do not count toward the entry cap.
- Discovered and documented the traversal gap for `--filespec` (filter applied only at file-processing time) and clarified why `--max-entries` fails to guard directory explosions.
- Refreshed `docs/2025.10.25 - CR - Repository review.md` with the new findings, corrected references, and added an explicit validation-command list for future audits.

## Update – Remediation Plan
- Authored `docs/2025.10.25 - PLAN - Repository remediation plan.md`, outlining five stages (critical fixes through monitoring) that map directly to the latest review findings.
- Captured acceptance criteria and validation hooks (e.g., re-running the `target`, `.bashrc`, and `fanout` repro commands) so future work can be verified systematically.
