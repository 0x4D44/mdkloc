## Context
- Run token: mdkloc review 2025-10-28T17:20:43Z
- Objective: review the "Code Review Guidance for AI Assistants" v3.0 document provided by the user and capture actionable takeaways for upcoming review work.

## Notes
- Guidance emphasizes consultant mindset: supply expert feedback without acting as gatekeeper.
- Severity framing: Critical (must fix), Important (should fix), Minor (could improve), Nit (optional). Need to label issues explicitly using prefixes.
- Recommended review flow: start with tests, move through design/correctness/maintainability/security, then polish.
- Tone guidance: focus on code not author, ask questions when uncertain, explain rationale, acknowledge positives.
- For documentation/artefact creation, must use slug prefix and follow repository naming conventions (docs vs journal placement).

## Next Steps
- Await specific code review or planning tasks for this run.
- When tasks arrive, apply checklist-driven review structure and maintain this journal with further observations.

## 17:55 UTC Update
- Re-read the initial code review report and tightened recommendations.
- Clarified the symlink handling bug with a concrete remediation plan (resolve file metadata while still blocking symlinked directories) and called out the need for regression coverage.
- Expanded the `max_entries` finding to emphasise counting directories and triggering the guard pre-filter.
- Noted follow-up on color handling to respect standard environment toggles.

## 18:05 UTC Update
- Second pass over the report to verify guidance and highlight next actions.
- Strengthened the symlink fix description with cross-platform considerations and explicit testing guidance.
- Emphasized that remediations should come with regression tests (symlinked files, filtered trees) to guard future changes.

## 18:15 UTC Update
- Produced a staged remediation plan covering correctness fixes (symlink handling, entry limits), UX polish (color handling, regression coverage), structural refactors, and validation/documentation follow-up.
- Plan saved as `docs/mdkloc_review_2025-10-28t172043z-2025.10.28 - PLAN - Remediation roadmap.md`.

## 18:45 UTC Update
- Captured the full "Comprehensive Coding Best Practices Guide (2025)" under the run slug as `docs/mdkloc_review_2025-10-28t172043z-2025.10.28 - SPEC - Comprehensive coding best practices guide (2025).md`.
- Noted it as the canonical Rust & TypeScript best-practices reference for future review cards in this workflow.

## 19:05 UTC Update
- Re-read the latest repository code review and built a new multi-stage implementation roadmap covering correctness hotfixes, regression tooling, UX cleanup, structural refactors, and release validation.
- Saved the plan as `docs/mdkloc_review_2025-10-28t172043z-2025.10.28 - PLAN - Implementation roadmap.md`.

## 19:40 UTC Update
- Began Stage 1 implementation: refactored traversal to increment entry counts before filtering, track visited canonical file paths, and follow symlinked files while still skipping symlinked directories.
- Introduced helper guard to surface `max_entries` limit with path context and prevented duplicate counting of symlink targets.
- Added regression tests: Unix-only symlink coverage and a max-entry filter exhaustion case; refreshed existing `process_file` tests to use the new guard flow.
- Ran `cargo fmt`; attempted `cargo test` but the run failed to fetch crates because network access to `static.crates.io` is blocked in this environment.

## 20:05 UTC Update
- Reverted accidental `Cargo.lock` version bump back to 2.2.0.
- Tried `cargo test --offline`, but the build still fails since required crates (e.g., `bitflags v2.8.0`) are not cached locally and the environment blocks outbound fetches. Test verification remains pending until dependencies become available.

## 20:25 UTC Update
- Advanced Stage 2 by extending the CLI smoke suite: added a Unix-only scenario confirming symlinked files are counted once, and a max-entry filter test that expects a hard failure when the limit is exceeded before filters apply.
- Implemented a small Unix helper for symlink creation within the integration harness.
- Ran `cargo fmt`; test execution remains blocked by unavailable remote crates.
