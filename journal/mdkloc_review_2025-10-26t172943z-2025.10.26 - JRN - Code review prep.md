## 2025-10-26 – mdkloc review 2025-10-26T17:29:43Z

- Gathered repository context and confirmed no existing artefacts for this run slug.
- Reviewed the shared “Code Review Guidance for AI Assistants” (v3.0, 2025-10-23) to align review approach with current expectations.
- Waiting on the specific change set or instructions for the code review focus before proceeding.
- Completed full-repo audit:
  - Confirmed user-reported regressions (ignored roots, shell dotfiles, ineffective `--max-entries`) with local reproductions.
  - Logged additional findings around traversal filters, documentation drift, and architectural debt.
  - Captured results in `docs/mdkloc_review_2025-10-26t172943z-2025.10.26 - CR - Full repository review.md`.
- Re-reviewed the report:
  - Noted that `--filespec`-filtered files bypass the entry counter, so documented the additional reproduction using `tmp-review/manytxt`.
  - Clarified how deferred filtering undermines both traversal limits and user expectations, updating the report summary and Findings 2/4 accordingly.
- Second re-review pass:
  - Discovered `process_file` drops any file whose extension is unmapped (e.g., `.txt`, `.md`), confirmed via `cargo run -- tmp-review/manytxt --non-recursive`.
  - Updated the report (new Important Finding 3) and testing gaps/suggested steps to cover default language fallback.
- Action planning:
  - Authored multistage roadmap (`docs/mdkloc_review_2025-10-26t172943z-2025.10.26 - PLAN - Remediation roadmap.md`) covering correctness fixes, traversal safeguards, documentation cleanup, and modularization follow-up.
