# Task Journal - Code Review Guidance Sync

**Date**: 2025-10-25  
**Context**: Received the latest Code Review Guidance for AI Assistants reference (v3.0, 2025-10-23) to keep on hand for upcoming review tasks.

## Actions
- Located the previously captured specification at `docs/2025.10.24 - SPEC - Code Review Guidance for AI Assistants.md` and confirmed it matches the supplied v3.0 text.
- Reviewed the prior journal entry (`journal/2025.10.24 - JRN - Code review guidance capture.md`) to refresh the documentation workflow expectations.

## Notes
- The existing spec already reflects Version 3.0, so no doc edits were required today.
- Will reference this guidance for severity classification, tone, and checklist usage in future reviews.
