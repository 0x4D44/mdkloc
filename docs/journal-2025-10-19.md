- Updated docs/coverage-progress-summary-2025-10-19.md, docs/progress-and-next-steps-2025-10-19.md, and docs/scan-directory-remaining-branches.md with the new coverage snapshot and outstanding scan-directory tasks.

## 15:14 (+01:00)
- Simplified aggregation assertions in 	est_scan_directory_mixed_failure_tree and 	est_scan_directory_alternating_failures, replacing double-removal logic with explicit flag checks, and added 	est_scan_directory_deeper_alternating_failures to exercise nested entry/read_dir/metadata/file-type permutations while confirming Rust stats persist.

- Refreshed docs/coverage-progress-summary-2025-10-19.md, docs/progress-and-next-steps-2025-10-19.md, and docs/scan-directory-remaining-branches.md with the new scenario, metrics, and revised TODOs.

## 15:19 (+01:00)
- Further adjusted 	est_scan_directory_mixed_failure_tree and 	est_scan_directory_alternating_failures to relocate stats before re-checking fallback lookups, ensuring the canonical?relative removal branch executes explicitly.
- Reran cargo fmt, cargo test, and cargo llvm-cov --workspace --summary-only --show-missing-lines; latest metrics: Regions 73.87%, Lines 95.09%, Functions 93.46%.
- Updated the coverage summary, progress tracker, and remaining-gaps doc with the new measurements and outstanding work.

## 15:23 (+01:00)

- Updated coverage docs to note the remaining aggregation/alternating gaps and the next steps.

## 16:08 (+01:00)
- Documented the intentional exclusion of the scan_directory aggregation branch (src/main.rs:3337-3374) in docs/coverage-progress-summary-2025-10-19.md so future coverage passes do not chase it inadvertently.
- Re-ran cargo fmt (clean), cargo clippy -- -D warnings (fails on clippy::if_same_then_else in src/main.rs:1275), and cargo test (passes) to capture the current verification state post-doc update.
- Prepared to enumerate fresh region-coverage strategies targeting the remaining scan_directory and dispatcher scenarios during the next planning round.

## 16:14 (+01:00)
- Executed cargo llvm-cov --workspace --summary-only --show-missing-lines to refresh coverage metrics (Regions 73.61%, Lines 94.95%, Functions 93.37%) and capture the latest uncovered line list for planning.
- Updated docs/progress-and-next-steps-2025-10-19.md with the exclusion rationale, current verification snapshot, and a renewed region-coverage action plan.
- Began drafting targeted coverage ideas around normalize_stats, dispatcher match arms, lossy reader error handling, progress reporting, and report formatting to push region coverage higher.

## 17:57 (+01:00)
- Added two targeted normalize_stats unit tests to cover both the blank-line reduction and underflow backfill branches (`src/main.rs`), then ran cargo fmt and cargo test normalize_stats (clean).
- Confirmed the new fixtures align with the region-coverage plan laid out in docs/progress-and-next-steps-2025-10-19.md; broader dispatcher coverage remains next on deck.

## 18:02 (+01:00)
- Added dispatcher smoke tests that route Algol, COBOL, Fortran, Velocity, and Mustache files through `count_lines_with_stats`, confirming the classic-language match arms execute under coverage instrumentation.
- Ran cargo fmt, targeted cargo test invocations for each new dispatcher case, and finally the full cargo test suite; all pass and exercise the intended extensions.

## 18:06 (+01:00)
- Refactored `LossyLineReader` to wrap a boxed `Read` so tests can inject custom readers, then added a failure-injection test that triggers the `Err` branch in `LossyLineReader::next`.
- Ran cargo fmt and cargo test test_lossy_line_reader_surfaces_errors to confirm the new harness works as expected.

## 18:09 (+01:00)
- Added `test_run_cli_with_metrics_emits_progress_output`, seeding multiple files while forcing `last_update` backwards so the CLI path emits live progress rates under coverage.
- Verified the new integration test with cargo test test_run_cli_with_metrics_emits_progress_output; progress output now appears in the captured writer.

## 18:12 (+01:00)
- Added `test_build_analysis_report_handles_zero_totals` to cover the branch that skips the summary/warning block when files and lines processed are zero.
- Ran cargo fmt and cargo test test_build_analysis_report_handles_zero_totals to confirm the report edge case behaves as expected.

## 18:13 (+01:00)
- Re-ran cargo clippy -- -D warnings (still fails on the known `clippy::if_same_then_else` in `count_velocity_lines`) and cargo llvm-cov --workspace --summary-only --show-missing-lines; latest snapshot reports Regions 73.67%, Lines 95.00%, Functions 93.59%.

## 18:15 (+01:00)
- Added `test_build_analysis_report_multiple_directories` to exercise report rendering across relative and absolute paths plus zero-code languages, ensuring totals and summary blocks render without warnings when error_count is zero.
- Ran cargo fmt and cargo test test_build_analysis_report_multiple_directories to validate the new coverage.

## 18:17 (+01:00)
- Reran cargo llvm-cov --workspace --summary-only --show-missing-lines after the new report coverage; metrics now read Regions 73.65%, Lines 94.98%, Functions 93.86%.

## 18:19 (+01:00)
- Added `test_scan_directory_non_recursive_skips_nested` to exercise the early return when `non_recursive` scans encounter depth > 0, covering the branch at `scan_directory_impl` line ~2021.
- Ran cargo fmt and cargo test test_scan_directory_non_recursive_skips_nested to validate the new path.

## 18:48 (+01:00)
- Added `test_rust_multiline_block_closes_with_trailing_code_same_line` so the `count_rust_lines` branch that resumes code after a multiline block (lines ~620-642) is evaluated.
- Ran cargo fmt and cargo test test_rust_multiline_block_closes_with_trailing_code_same_line to confirm the additional Rust coverage.

## 18:50 (+01:00)
- Added `test_rust_block_comment_followed_by_line_comment_same_line` to drive the branch where a block comment closes and a trailing `//` comment suppresses additional code counting on the same line.
- Ran cargo fmt and cargo test test_rust_block_comment_followed_by_line_comment_same_line; expectations reflect that only the block counts as a comment while the trailing line is ignored.

## 18:54 (+01:00)
- Appended `cli_filespec_handles_uppercase_extensions` to `tests/cli_smoke.rs`, verifying uppercase `--filespec` filters interact correctly with `get_language_from_extension` and CLI output (counts Rust, omits non-matching files).
- Ran cargo fmt, cargo test cli_filespec_handles_uppercase_extensions, the full cargo test suite, and cargo llvm-cov --workspace --summary-only --show-missing-lines; coverage snapshot now sits at Regions 73.60%, Lines 94.95%, Functions 93.91%.

## 19:58 (+01:00)
- Added `test_scan_directory_alternating_success_failure_deeper` to extend the alternating failure tree coverage, hitting the remaining branches around `scan_directory_impl` lines 3313–3666.
- Ran cargo fmt and cargo test test_scan_directory_alternating_success_failure_deeper; noted the unused variable warning for the file-type sentinel, which is intentional to keep the branch structure intact.

## 20:01 (+01:00)
- Added `test_build_analysis_report_long_path_truncation` and `cli_filespec_and_ignore_combination` to cover report truncation logic and combined CLI flag handling.
- Ran cargo fmt, targeted cargo test invocations, the full cargo test suite, and cargo llvm-cov --workspace --summary-only --show-missing-lines; coverage now reports Regions 73.36%, Lines 94.87%, Functions 93.70%.

## 20:04 (+01:00)
- Added `cli_verbose_color_combination` to cover verbose execution paths alongside ignore patterns, then revalidated with cargo fmt, the focused test, the full suite, and cargo llvm-cov (coverage unchanged: Regions 73.36%, Lines 94.87%, Functions 93.70%).
