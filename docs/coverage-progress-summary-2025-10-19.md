# Coverage Progress Summary - 2025-10-19 (20:04 UTC+01:00)

## Progress So Far
- Extended scan-directory fault-injection coverage with deeper mixed failure trees (`test_scan_directory_failure_counter_accumulates`, `test_scan_directory_failure_counter_exceeds_four`, alternating/nested permutations), recursion checks (`test_scan_directory_records_recursive_error`), multi-level trees (`test_scan_directory_extended_failure_tree`), sibling scenarios (`test_scan_directory_multiple_entry_failure_branches`, `test_scan_directory_duplicate_canonical_merge`, `test_scan_directory_canonical_fallback_alias_key`), and dispatcher permutations for `.tfvars.json` suffix chains to keep routing behaviour thorough.
- Hardened Velocity parsing logic with inline, multiline, whitespace-only, trailing-code, and trailing-comment fixtures so `count_velocity_lines` exercises all trailing-fragment branches.
- Added dispatcher smoke tests routing Algol, COBOL, Fortran, Velocity, and Mustache files through `count_lines_with_stats`, plus targeted `normalize_stats` coverage to light up the newly added classic-language and normalization branches.
- Refactored `LossyLineReader` to accept any `Read` source and added a failure-injection test, ensuring the iterator error path is represented in coverage.
- Introduced CLI and report-edge tests (`test_run_cli_with_metrics_emits_progress_output`, `test_build_analysis_report_handles_zero_totals`, `test_build_analysis_report_multiple_directories`, `test_build_analysis_report_long_path_truncation`, `test_build_analysis_report_language_ordering`, `cli_filespec_handles_uppercase_extensions`, `cli_filespec_and_ignore_combination`, `cli_verbose_color_combination`, `cli_color_filespec_ignore_combination`) so progress output, summary skipping, uppercase filespec handling, and combined CLI flags are exercised.
- Maintained the verification cadence (`cargo fmt`, `cargo test`, `cargo llvm-cov --workspace --summary-only --show-missing-lines`); the latest run (20:04 UTC+01:00) reports Regions 73.38%, Lines 94.89%, Functions 93.72%. `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` still fails on the known `clippy::if_same_then_else` in `count_velocity_lines`.

## Known Exclusions
- The `scan_directory` aggregation branch at `src/main.rs:3337-3374` is intentionally left uncovered; exercising it would require OS-specific canonical aliasing that the test harness cannot produce reliably. Revisit only if we introduce cross-platform fixture support for duplicate canonical paths.

## Next Steps
1. Investigate the remaining report-formatting gaps (e.g., long-path truncation, language ordering) and verify they show up in coverage.
2. Monitor coverage reports for unexpected regressions in the excluded aggregation branch, ensuring the documented rationale stays valid.
3. Keep `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`, `cargo test`, and `cargo llvm-cov --workspace --summary-only --show-missing-lines` in the verification loop after each batch.
