Progress Summary (2025-10-19)
=============================

Recent Improvements
-------------------
- Completed dispatcher regression coverage for `.tfvars.json` permutations, ensuring mixed- and upper-case variants route into the JSON path.
- Hardened `count_hcl_lines` with new multi-line fixtures so block closures that resume code, then transition into trailing `##`/`//`/`#` comments, now hit the `in_block` continuation path near `src/main.rs:1233-1249`.
- Added combined scan-directory failure-injection coverage that exercises entry-iteration, file-type, read-dir, and metadata sentinels in one traversal, plus a root-sibling metadata failure to ensure healthy directories remain in stats.
- Backfilled Mustache coverage with comment-only, inline, and multi-line-without-trailing-code fixtures so the comment-only branches and continuation paths are now covered.
- Introduced a dispatcher regression for `.tfvars.json.bak`, confirming compound extensions fall back to generic counting without panicking.
- Added Velocity fixtures for inline, multi-line, and whitespace-only block closures without trailing content, plus new scan-directory permutations combining metadata/read_dir/entry iteration failures and `.tfvars.json` suffix fallbacks.
- Implemented `test_velocity_multiline_block_closes_with_trailing_code` and `test_velocity_multiline_block_closes_with_trailing_comment` so the `in_block` closure logic now exercises the trailing code and trailing `##` comment branches.
- Added `test_velocity_code_before_block_with_whitespace_tail` to ensure inline code preceding a block with a whitespace-only tail exercises the `after_trimmed.is_empty()` path in `count_velocity_lines`.
- Introduced `test_scan_directory_max_depth_with_failures` and `test_scan_directory_ignore_list_retains_siblings` to exercise the max-depth warning path and explicit ignore lists.
- Added `test_scan_directory_deep_alternating_failures` and `test_scan_directory_failure_counter_accumulates` to stress deeper mixed failure trees and confirm cumulative error counts; verification pass kept coverage at Regions 74.89%, Lines 95.27%, Functions 93.88%.
- Added `test_scan_directory_failure_counter_exceeds_four` to push the simulated error counter well beyond four while ensuring healthy directories continue aggregating Rust stats.
- Re-ran `cargo fmt`, `cargo test`, and `cargo llvm-cov --workspace --summary-only --show-missing-lines`; the 2025-10-19 11:38 (+01:00) run reports Regions 74.89%, Lines 95.27%, Functions 93.88%.
- Latest verification (2025-10-19 12:36 (+01:00)) after the new Velocity fixtures reports Regions 74.63%, Lines 95.20%, Functions 93.67%.
- Current coverage (2025-10-19 12:46 (+01:00)) after the deeper failure aggregation test reports Regions 74.47%, Lines 95.16%, Functions 93.13%.
- Latest verification (2025-10-19 12:56 (+01:00)) after the inline code/whitespace Velocity fixture reports Regions 74.45%, Lines 95.15%, Functions 93.15%.

Open Areas
----------
- `count_velocity_lines`: closing-line instrumentation still flags `src/main.rs:1392` even after the new trailing code/comment fixtures—confirm whether a whitespace-only closure path is missing or if the branch is being optimised away during coverage.
- Scan-directory: despite the additional aggregation test, coverage gaps linger around `src/main.rs:3010-3370` and the alternating path near `src/main.rs:3683-3690`; investigate whether further sentinel layouts or instrumentation tweaks are required.
- Dispatcher: confirm behaviour for compound extensions (e.g., `.tfvars.JSON.bak`) and any additional mixed-case config aliases coverage still flags.

Next Steps
----------
1. Re-check `count_velocity_lines` coverage by crafting an explicit whitespace-only closing fixture (or debugging instrumentation) so the branch around `src/main.rs:1392` no longer shows as uncovered.
2. Explore scan-directory scenarios with multiple sibling sentinel directories (e.g., metadata + read_dir + entry iteration at the same depth) and deeper alternating success/failure chains to cover the remaining assertions at `src/main.rs:3010-3370` and `src/main.rs:3683-3690`.
3. Continue expanding dispatcher edge cases (e.g., `.tfvars.JSON.bak` variants with extra suffixes) and refresh the coverage progress log after the next `cargo llvm-cov --workspace --summary-only --show-missing-lines` run.
