# Coverage Progress - 2025-10-18

## Recent Work
- Expanded Python docstring edge cases with fixtures covering trailing code, trailing comments, blank lines, whitespace-only lines, whitespace-plus-comment sequences, and the new `doc_with_whitespace_code.py` case that resumes code after a whitespace separator—exercising the branch range around lines 670-686 in `count_python_lines`.
- Added YAML and TOML inline hash-comment fixtures, fully driving `count_hash_comment_lines` across comment/blank/code permutations.
- Extended HCL coverage with both multi-line and unterminated block-comment fixtures, and introduced mixed HCL/INI fixtures (`combo.tf`, `mixed.tf`, `mixed.ini`) that close block comments mid-line before trailing hash comments, covering `count_hcl_lines` and dispatcher logic near lines 1228 and 3060.
- Added focused fixtures for `/* ... */ //` transitions (`block_then_line.tf`, `block_line_code.tf`), line-comment-to-hash sequences (`line_then_hash.tf`), blank separators (`blank_lines.tf`), dispatcher case-insensitivity/uppercase coverage (`CONFIG.INI`, `SETTINGS.CFG`, `variables.TFVARS`, `variables.TfVars.json`, `SAMPLE.CONF`), new Velocity scenarios covering blank lines plus block-closure trailing code and trailing line comments (with `count_velocity_lines` now treating trailing `##`/`//`/`#` as comments), new Mustache fixtures that hit blank-line and trailing-code-after-comment paths, additional HCL fixtures (`inline_block_line.tf`, `inline_block_hash.tf`, `block_then_hash_line.tf`, `inline_block_doc.tf`) that place hash or line comments immediately after inline and multiline blocks, dispatcher regressions for `terraform.tfvars.json` variants, and nested scan-directory failure-injection tests that ensure metadata/read_dir errors increment counts without blowing away sibling stats.
- Verifying suite continues to pass (`cargo fmt`, `cargo test`, `cargo llvm-cov`) and the 2025-10-18 coverage run sits at Regions 76.50%, Lines 95.84%, Functions 95.96% (`cargo llvm-cov --workspace --summary-only --show-missing-lines`).

## Next Steps
1. Review the remaining `count_hcl_lines` uncovered span around lines 1339-1355 (now the debug-assert branch) to confirm whether additional markers need handling or the loop can be simplified further.
2. Address the lingering dispatcher hot spots near 3050 by broadening fixtures for other mixed-case config extensions (e.g., `.TfVars.json` variants with additional suffixes) and nested cases if coverage still flags those paths after the latest uppercase additions.
3. Continue the `cargo fmt`, `cargo test`, and `cargo llvm-cov --workspace --summary-only --show-missing-lines` cadence after each fixture to track incremental improvements.
