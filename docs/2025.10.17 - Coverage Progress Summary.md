# Coverage Progress Summary â€” 2025-10-17

## Highlights
- Added regression fixtures across hash-driven parsers (TOML, YAML, Makefile, Dockerfile) to cover comment-only and blank-only scenarios.
- Exercised block-close + trailing comment branches for Rust, JavaScript, C-style, and PowerShell parsers.
- Extended directory coverage with tests for max-depth warnings and auto-ignored directories (e.g., `.git`, `node_modules`).
- Strengthened CLI smoke suite with cases for `--max-depth`, malformed `--filespec`, and `--max-entries 0` handling.
- Coverage snapshots throughout the day show incremental improvements to line/function coverage, though region coverage remains below the 85% target (latest run: regions 76.90%, lines 94.74%, functions 95.09% with 773 regions and 204 lines uncovered).

## Outstanding Gaps
- Region coverage still trails the 85% goal; parser branches in JSX/TOML/YAML and mixed CLI warning paths remain under-tested.
- Progress reporting paths (throttled updates, error counts) require additional coverage.
- Need to confirm coverage for auto-ignore patterns beyond `.git`/`node_modules` (e.g., `target`, `dist`) and for mixed hash-plus-blank files in other loaders.

## Next Steps
1. **Parser Sprint Continuation**
   - Add table-driven fixtures targeting residual branches (JSX multi-line blends, YAML/TOML edge cases, PowerShell mixed warnings).
   - Validate hash-only loaders with comment/blank permutations across remaining file types.
2. **CLI & Progress Coverage**
   - Craft integration tests that trigger throttled progress updates, read failures, and combined ignore patterns to exercise warning output and error counters.
3. **Coverage Gate Preparation**
   - Once region coverage approaches 85%, wire up the planned CI guard (`cargo llvm-cov --fail-under-lines 94 --fail-under-regions 85`) and document the workflow.
4. **Documentation Refresh**
   - Summarize new regression suites and coverage guidance in `readme.md`, ensuring contributors can reproduce the added tests and interpret warnings.
