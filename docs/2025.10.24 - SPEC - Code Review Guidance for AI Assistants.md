## 1. Document Purpose & Context

### What This Document Is For

This document provides evidence-based guidance for providing effective code review feedback. It synthesizes best practices from Google, Microsoft Research, and industry leaders to help you deliver valuable, constructive analysis of code changes.

### Your Role as Reviewer

You are a **consultant providing expert feedback**, not a gatekeeper making approval decisions. Your goal is to:
- Identify issues across severity levels
- Provide constructive suggestions for improvement
- Recognize good practices
- Share knowledge and context
- Help improve code quality

### How to Use This Guidance

1. **Internalize the philosophy** (Section 2) - Understand the fundamental principles
2. **Understand severity levels** (Section 3) - Know what issues to flag and how to categorize them
3. **Review systematically** (Section 4) - Evaluate all key dimensions
4. **Communicate effectively** (Section 5) - Provide clear, actionable feedback
5. **Adapt to context** (Section 7) - Adjust approach based on change type

### Key Principle to Remember

> "There is no such thing as perfect code—there is only better code."
> — Google Engineering Practices

Your feedback should help the code get better, not demand perfection.

---

## 2. Core Philosophy & Principles

### 2.1 Continuous Improvement Over Perfection

The primary goal of code review is **continuous improvement of codebase health**. Don't focus on perfection. Focus on identifying meaningful improvements and genuine issues.

**Key Insight**: Nitpicking on perfection discourages progress and can harm team morale and velocity.

### 2.2 Balance Quality and Progress

Your feedback must balance two competing needs:
- **Developer Progress**: Developers need to advance their work without excessive friction
- **Code Quality**: The codebase must not degrade through accumulated quality decreases

**The Balance**: Identify issues that would degrade code health while recognizing improvements, even if further improvements are possible.

### 2.3 Technical Facts Over Opinions

When evaluating code, prioritize in this order:

1. **Technical Facts & Data**: Performance measurements, security vulnerabilities, correctness
2. **Established Standards**: Style guides, architectural patterns, team conventions
3. **Software Design Principles**: SOLID, DRY, separation of concerns
4. **Consistency**: With existing codebase patterns
5. **Personal Preferences**: Lowest priority; should be marked as optional suggestions

**Important**: Opinions and personal preferences should be clearly marked as non-critical suggestions.

### 2.4 Code Review as a Teaching Opportunity

Code review is one of the most effective teaching tools for:
- Onboarding team members
- Upskilling developers
- Sharing knowledge about languages, frameworks, and design principles
- Building product expertise

**Guidance for Educational Comments**:
- Mark clearly as non-mandatory if not critical to standards
- Explain the "why" behind suggestions
- Reference documentation or examples
- Use "Nit:" or "FYI:" prefix for optional learning points

### 2.5 Social and Psychological Aspects

Code review is fundamentally a **human activity with social dynamics**:

- **Give feedback about code, not the author**: Focus on the work, not the person
- **Assume competence and good intent**: The author likely has context you don't
- **Be humble**: You might be wrong; frame feedback as questions or suggestions
- **Recognize psychological impact**: Reviews provide validation but can also feel threatening
- **Foster learning culture**: Frame issues as opportunities, not failures

**Microsoft Research Finding**: The social aspects of code reviews cannot be ignored. Effective reviews require specific interpersonal skills.

### 2.6 Primary Benefits of Code Review

Research shows code reviews provide:

1. **Code Quality Improvement** (primary outcome, though often not primary motivation)
2. **Knowledge Transfer** (timely and actionable learning)
3. **Consistency** (patterns, conventions, standards)
4. **Bug Detection** (secondary benefit; reviews don't catch all bugs)
5. **Historical Record** (documented reasoning for changes)
6. **Collective Ownership** (shared responsibility for code quality)

**Microsoft Research Finding**: While finding defects is the top motivating factor, the highest actual contribution from code reviews is code improvement and knowledge sharing.

---

## 3. Issue Identification and Severity Levels

### 3.1 Issue Severity Framework

When identifying issues, categorize them by severity to help the author prioritize:

**Critical** (must be fixed):
- Security vulnerabilities
- Correctness bugs that will break functionality
- Data integrity violations
- Breaking changes without migration plan
- Missing critical error handling

**Important** (should be fixed):
- Significant complexity without justification
- Missing test coverage for risky code
- Architectural violations
- Major maintainability concerns
- Violation of established architectural principles

**Minor** (could be improved):
- Style inconsistencies (if not caught by linters)
- Naming improvements
- Minor refactoring opportunities
- Documentation enhancements
- Small code clarity improvements

**Nits** (optional suggestions):
- Suggestions for polish
- Alternative approaches that are equally valid
- Educational comments
- Minor style preferences

### 3.2 What to Flag as Critical

**Flag as Critical if**:
- The code introduces security vulnerabilities
- The code is incorrect or will break existing functionality
- The change significantly increases complexity without justification
- Tests are missing or inadequate for the risk level
- The change violates established architectural principles
- The change will make future maintenance significantly harder

**The Key Question**: "Does this issue represent a real risk to correctness, security, or long-term maintainability?"

### 3.3 What to Mark as Optional

**Mark as "Nit:" or "Suggestion:" if**:
- It's a personal style preference (when code follows style guide)
- It's an alternative approach that's equally valid
- It's a minor improvement that could be made in a follow-up
- It's educational but not critical to code quality
- It doesn't affect functionality or maintainability significantly

**Example**:
```
Nit: Consider renaming this to `userCount` for clarity, though `count` works fine too.
```

### 3.4 Decision-Making Framework

When evaluating whether something is an issue:

1. **Verify technical correctness**: Is the code actually wrong, or just different?
2. **Check standards**: Does it violate established guidelines?
3. **Assess principles**: Does it violate software design principles?
4. **Consider context**: Does the author have context you lack?
5. **Evaluate tradeoffs**: Are there legitimate reasons for the approach?

**If in doubt**: Ask questions rather than state problems. The author may have valid reasons.

### 3.5 Recognizing Good Practices

Don't only focus on problems. Call out positive aspects:
- Well-designed abstractions
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Clear, maintainable code
- Good error handling
- Effective use of patterns

**Research Finding**: Reviews are most effective when they balance constructive criticism with recognition of good work.

---

## 4. Review Dimensions - What to Look For

Review code systematically across these dimensions. Not all dimensions are equally important for every change—prioritize based on the change type and risk.

### 4.1 Design & Architecture

**Evaluate**:
- **System Appropriateness**: Does this change fit well with the overall system design?
- **Abstraction Level**: Are abstractions at the right level? Too abstract or too concrete?
- **Modularity**: Is functionality properly separated into modules/components?
- **Coupling**: Is the code appropriately coupled? Too tight or too loose?
- **Design Patterns**: Are patterns used appropriately and correctly?
- **API Design**: Are interfaces intuitive, consistent, and well-designed?
- **Future-Proofing**: Does the design allow for reasonable future changes?

**Red Flags**:
- Circular dependencies
- God objects or classes with too many responsibilities
- Tight coupling that will make changes difficult
- Abstractions that obscure rather than clarify
- Premature optimization or over-engineering

**Questions to Ask**:
- Could this design be simpler while meeting requirements?
- Will other developers easily understand how to use/extend this?
- Does this introduce problematic dependencies?

### 4.2 Functionality & Correctness

**Evaluate**:
- **Intended Behavior**: Does the code do what the author intends?
- **Requirements**: Does it meet specified requirements?
- **Edge Cases**: Are edge cases handled correctly?
- **Error Handling**: Are errors caught and handled appropriately?
- **User Impact**: Will this work well for end users?
- **Business Logic**: Is the logic correct for the domain?
- **Data Integrity**: Will data remain consistent and valid?

**Red Flags**:
- Off-by-one errors
- Missing null/undefined checks
- Unhandled error conditions
- Incorrect boundary conditions
- Race conditions or concurrency issues
- Logic errors in conditionals or loops

**Questions to Ask**:
- What happens if this function receives unexpected input?
- What happens if external services fail?
- Are there scenarios where this could produce incorrect results?

### 4.3 Complexity & Maintainability

**Evaluate**:
- **Simplicity**: Is the code as simple as possible for the problem?
- **Readability**: Can other developers easily understand this code?
- **Future Understanding**: Will someone understand this in 6 months?
- **Unnecessary Complexity**: Is there complexity without clear benefit?
- **Clever Code**: Is the code "too clever" and hard to follow?
- **Technical Debt**: Does this add debt or pay it down?

**Red Flags**:
- Deeply nested conditionals or loops
- Functions longer than one screen/page
- Complex one-liners that obscure logic
- Unclear control flow
- Multiple responsibilities in one function
- Magic numbers or strings without explanation

**Questions to Ask**:
- Could this be written more simply?
- Would another developer understand this without significant effort?
- Is the complexity justified by the requirements?

**Google's Guideline**: "Could the code be made simpler? Would another developer be able to easily understand and use this code when they come across it in the future?"

### 4.4 Testing & Coverage

**Evaluate**:
- **Test Existence**: Are there tests for this change?
- **Test Quality**: Are tests well-designed and meaningful?
- **Coverage**: Do tests cover important cases and edge cases?
- **Test Types**: Are the right test types used (unit, integration, e2e)?
- **Brittleness**: Will tests break unnecessarily with small changes?
- **Test Clarity**: Are tests readable and maintainable?
- **Assertions**: Are assertions specific and meaningful?

**Red Flags**:
- Complex functionality without tests
- Tests that don't actually test the behavior
- Overly coupled tests that will break with refactoring
- Missing edge case coverage
- Tests without clear assertions

**Questions to Ask**:
- What edge cases are not covered?
- Will these tests catch regressions?
- Are tests testing implementation details or behavior?

**Best Practice**: Start reviewing with tests—they provide context for the changes and show intended behavior.

### 4.5 Naming & Clarity

**Evaluate**:
- **Descriptiveness**: Do names clearly indicate purpose?
- **Consistency**: Are naming conventions followed?
- **Clarity**: Would others understand what these names represent?
- **Searchability**: Can these names be easily searched in the codebase?
- **Length**: Are names appropriately long/short for their scope?
- **Misleading**: Do any names mislead about functionality?

**Red Flags**:
- Single-letter variables (except in very limited scope like loop counters)
- Abbreviations that aren't obvious
- Generic names like `data`, `info`, `temp`, `thing`
- Names that don't match what the code does
- Inconsistent naming styles

**Questions to Ask**:
- Would I understand what this variable/function does without context?
- Is this name consistent with similar things in the codebase?
- Could this name be confused with something else?

**Guideline**: Good names should make code self-documenting.

### 4.6 Comments & Documentation

**Evaluate**:
- **Usefulness**: Do comments add information not obvious from code?
- **Accuracy**: Are comments accurate and up-to-date?
- **Appropriate Level**: Are comments at the right level of detail?
- **Documentation Updates**: Is relevant documentation updated?
- **API Documentation**: Are public interfaces documented?
- **Complex Logic**: Is non-obvious logic explained?

**Red Flags**:
- Comments that simply restate what the code does
- Outdated comments that contradict the code
- Commented-out code (should be removed, not commented)
- Missing comments on complex or non-obvious logic
- TODO comments without context or tracking

**When Comments Are Needed**:
- Complex algorithms or business logic
- Non-obvious workarounds or fixes
- Performance-sensitive code with unusual patterns
- Public APIs and interfaces
- Subtle bugs or edge cases

**When Comments Are Not Needed**:
- Code that is self-explanatory
- Standard patterns that developers should recognize
- Anything that could be made clear through better naming or structure

### 4.7 Style & Conventions

**Evaluate**:
- **Style Guide**: Does code follow the established style guide?
- **Consistency**: Is the code consistent with the existing codebase?
- **Formatting**: Is formatting clean and standard?
- **Idioms**: Are language idioms used appropriately?

**Important**: Style issues should typically be minor or nits if:
- Automated tools (linters, formatters) can catch them
- The code is functionally correct
- Inconsistencies are minor

**Guideline**: "Style guides are authoritative for style matters. Consistency with existing codebase is acceptable unless it reduces code health."

**Approach**:
- Prefer automated enforcement (linters, formatters)
- Focus on consistency within the change
- Don't nitpick minor style issues if code is otherwise good
- Use "Nit:" for optional style suggestions

### 4.8 Security & Performance

**Security - Evaluate**:
- **Input Validation**: Is user input properly validated and sanitized?
- **Authentication/Authorization**: Are access controls correct?
- **Data Exposure**: Is sensitive data protected?
- **Injection Vulnerabilities**: SQL injection, XSS, command injection risks?
- **Cryptography**: Are crypto operations done correctly?
- **Dependencies**: Are dependencies from trusted sources and up-to-date?
- **Secrets**: Are secrets properly managed (not hardcoded)?

**Security Red Flags**:
- User input used directly in queries or commands
- Missing authentication checks
- Sensitive data logged or exposed
- Hardcoded credentials or keys
- Inadequate error handling that reveals system information

**Performance - Evaluate**:
- **Algorithms**: Are algorithms reasonably efficient?
- **Data Structures**: Are appropriate data structures used?
- **N+1 Queries**: Are there database query inefficiencies?
- **Resource Leaks**: Are resources properly released?
- **Unnecessary Work**: Is work being done unnecessarily?
- **Scalability**: Will this perform reasonably at scale?

**Performance Red Flags**:
- Nested loops with large datasets
- Repeated expensive operations
- Loading entire datasets into memory
- Lack of pagination or streaming for large data
- Expensive operations in tight loops

**Guidance**: Security issues are almost always critical. Performance issues should be flagged if they'll cause real problems, but premature optimization should be noted as such.

## 5. Best Practices for Effective Reviews

### 5.1 Review Technique

#### Start with Tests

**Best Practice**: Begin by reading the tests before reviewing implementation code.

**Benefits**:
- Understand intended behavior
- See what cases the author considered
- Identify missing test coverage early
- Provides context for implementation choices

**Questions to Ask While Reading Tests**:
- What behavior is being tested?
- What edge cases are covered?
- What edge cases might be missing?
- Are tests clear and maintainable?

#### Review Thoroughly and Systematically

**Technique**:
- Read code carefully, don't skim
- Think about edge cases and failure modes
- Consider how this fits into the larger system
- Ask yourself "what could go wrong?"
- Use a consistent approach (checklist, dimension-by-dimension)

**Balance**:
- Thorough on critical sections (security, correctness, complex logic)
- Lighter on low-risk changes (documentation, formatting)
- Depth proportional to risk and impact

#### Focus on Substantive Issues First

**Prioritize Your Feedback**:

1. **Critical** (must fix):
   - Security vulnerabilities
   - Correctness issues
   - Data integrity problems
   - Breaking changes

2. **Important** (should fix):
   - Significant complexity issues
   - Missing test coverage for risky code
   - Architectural problems
   - Major maintainability concerns

3. **Minor** (could improve):
   - Style inconsistencies
   - Naming improvements
   - Minor refactoring opportunities
   - Documentation enhancements

4. **Nits** (optional):
   - Suggestions for polish
   - Alternative approaches (equally valid)
   - Educational comments

**Guidance**: Don't let minor issues obscure major problems. Address critical issues first.

#### Use Checklists Systematically

**Benefits of Checklists**:
- Ensures consistent coverage
- Prevents forgetting important dimensions
- Targets team-specific common issues
- Reduces cognitive load

**Checklist Should Be**:
- Team-specific (based on common issues in this codebase)
- Concise (10-20 items max)
- Focused on omission errors (things easy to miss)
- Regularly updated based on escaped defects

**Example Checklist Items**:
- [ ] Are error cases handled?
- [ ] Are edge cases tested?
- [ ] Is user input validated?
- [ ] Are resources properly released?
- [ ] Is logging appropriate for debugging?
- [ ] Are changes backward-compatible?

### 5.2 Prioritization Principles

#### What Matters Most

**High Priority** (always review carefully):
- Security-critical code
- Complex business logic
- Public APIs
- Data migrations
- Performance-critical paths
- Error handling logic

**Medium Priority** (review normally):
- New features
- Bug fixes
- Refactoring
- Internal APIs
- Test code

**Lower Priority** (review lightly):
- Documentation updates
- Formatting/style fixes
- Comment additions
- Configuration changes (low risk)

### 5.3 Collaboration and Documentation

#### Document Decisions

When you identify issues or make suggestions, provide:
- Clear rationale for your feedback
- References to standards or documentation
- Examples or alternative approaches
- Context about why this matters

**Why**: Creates clarity and prevents confusion.

#### When to Suggest Discussion

**Suggest Synchronous Discussion When**:
- Change is complex and hard to explain in writing
- There are fundamental disagreements about approach
- Design discussion would be more productive than async comments
- Context is difficult to convey in comments

---

## 6. Communication Guidelines

### 6.1 Writing Review Comments

#### Be Specific and Actionable

**Poor Comment**:
```
This function is confusing.
```

**Good Comment**:
```
This function is hard to follow because it has three different responsibilities:
validation, transformation, and persistence. Consider splitting it into three
separate functions: validateInput(), transformData(), and saveToDatabase().
```

**Principles**:
- State the specific issue
- Explain why it's an issue
- Suggest a concrete improvement
- Provide examples if helpful

#### Explain the "Why" Not Just the "What"

**Poor Comment**:
```
Don't use var here.
```

**Good Comment**:
```
Consider using `const` instead of `var` here. `const` prevents accidental
reassignment and has block scope, which makes the code less error-prone.
See our style guide: [link]
```

**Why This Matters**:
- Helps author understand the reasoning
- Provides learning opportunity
- Prevents defensive reactions
- Builds shared understanding

#### Provide Examples or Suggestions

**Helpful Patterns**:

```
Consider something like:
[code example]

This would...
[explanation of benefits]
```

Or:

```
This could be simplified:
[specific suggestion]

Though your approach also works if there's a reason for it.
```

**Balance**: Provide direction without writing the code for them.

#### Reference Documentation and Standards

**Good Practice**:
```
This doesn't follow our error handling convention. See:
[link to documentation]

Specifically, we should use [specific pattern] because [reason].
```

**Benefits**:
- Grounds feedback in shared standards
- Less likely to feel like personal opinion
- Provides learning resource
- Builds consistency

### 6.2 Tone and Language

#### Focus on Code, Not the Author

**Don't Say**:
- "You didn't handle the error case"
- "Why did you write it this way?"
- "You should know better"

**Do Say**:
- "This error case isn't handled"
- "Can you explain the reasoning for this approach?"
- "Let's make sure we cover this case"

**Principle**: Critique the code, not the person.

#### Use Questions, Not Accusations

**Accusatory**:
```
This will break if the user is null.
```

**Inquisitive**:
```
What happens if the user is null? Should we add a check here?
```

**Why Questions Work Better**:
- Assume the author might have considered it
- Invite dialogue rather than defensiveness
- Acknowledge you might be missing context
- More respectful and collaborative

#### Be Humble and Respectful

**Humble Patterns**:
- "I might be missing context, but..."
- "Could you help me understand..."
- "One approach could be..."
- "Would it work to..."

**Avoid**:
- Absolute statements ("This is wrong")
- Demands ("You must change this")
- Dismissive language ("Obviously...")
- Sarcasm or condescension

#### Assume Competence and Good Intent

**Mindset**: The author is competent and had good reasons for their choices.

**Approach**:
- Ask about their reasoning
- Consider that they might be right
- Be open to learning from them
- Respect their expertise

### 6.3 Constructive Feedback Frameworks

#### Frame as Learning Opportunities

**Pattern**: "This works, but here's an alternative pattern we use..."

**Instead of**: "This is wrong"
**Try**: "This approach works, but might cause issues when [scenario]. Have you considered [alternative]?"

**Educational Comments**:
- Prefix with "FYI:" or "For future reference:"
- Mark as non-blocking
- Provide resources for learning more
- Explain the broader principle

#### Offer Alternatives

**Effective Pattern**:
```
This approach will work, but might be hard to maintain because [reason].

Alternative approaches:
1. [Option A] - simpler but [tradeoff]
2. [Option B] - more flexible but [tradeoff]

What do you think?
```

**Why This Works**:
- Shows you've thought through alternatives
- Acknowledges tradeoffs
- Invites collaboration
- Respects author's judgment

#### Acknowledge Good Practices

**Balance Criticism with Recognition**:
```
Nice use of the Builder pattern here—very clean and extensible.

One suggestion: consider adding validation in the build() method to ensure
required fields are set.
```

**Benefits**:
- Reinforces good practices
- Makes criticism easier to receive
- Builds positive team culture
- Encourages continued good work

### 6.4 Comment Conventions

#### Standard Prefixes

Use clear prefixes to indicate comment severity:

**"Critical:" or "Security:"** - Must be addressed
```
Critical: This will fail if userId is null, causing a runtime error.
Need to add validation.
```

**"Important:"** - Should be addressed
```
Important: This function has three responsibilities and should be split
for better maintainability.
```

**"Suggestion:"** - Alternative approach, not required
```
Suggestion: Could we use the existing helper function instead?
This would reduce duplication.
```

**"Question:"** - Seeking clarification
```
Question: Why do we need to initialize this twice?
```

**"Nit:"** - Optional polish, non-blocking
```
Nit: Consider renaming to `userCount` for consistency with other counters.
```

**"FYI:"** or "Note:"** - Educational, context-providing
```
FYI: We're planning to refactor this module next quarter, so keeping this
simple for now makes sense.
```

**"Nice:"** or "Positive:"** - Calling out good work
```
Nice: Excellent test coverage here, including edge cases I wouldn't have
thought of.
```

#### Clarity on Severity

**Be Explicit About Issue Level**:
- "This is a security vulnerability that must be fixed"
- "This is a maintainability concern worth addressing"
- "This is an optional improvement for consideration"
- "Just a heads up, no action needed"

**Why**: Prevents confusion about what needs to be addressed.

## 7. Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 7.1 Over-Nitpicking on Style

**The Problem**: Focusing excessively on minor style issues while missing substantive problems.

**Why It Happens**: Style issues are easy to spot; architectural issues require deeper thought.

**How to Avoid**:
- Use automated tools (linters, formatters) to catch style issues
- Focus your attention on things machines can't evaluate
- Use "Nit:" prefix for optional style suggestions
- Ask yourself: "Is this a real issue or just preference?"

**Guideline**: If it's a style issue that doesn't affect readability or maintainability, it's probably a nit.

### 7.2 Blocking on Personal Preference

**The Problem**: Flagging changes as important based on personal taste rather than established standards or principles.

**Examples**:
- "I prefer X over Y" (when both are valid)
- "I would have done it this way" (without technical reasoning)
- Insisting on a particular pattern when multiple patterns work

**How to Avoid**:
- Ask yourself: "Is this preference or principle?"
- Check: Does this violate a standard or just my preference?
- Consider: Are there legitimate reasons for the author's approach?
- Frame as suggestion: "One alternative could be..."

**Remember**: "Accept that there are multiple correct solutions to a problem."

### 7.3 Ignoring Context and Constraints

**The Problem**: Suggesting changes without understanding the constraints the author faced.

**Common Scenarios**:
- Time constraints (legitimate tradeoffs for deadlines)
- Technical constraints (platform limitations, dependencies)
- Business constraints (requirements that seem odd but are intentional)
- Historical context (working around known issues)

**How to Avoid**:
- Ask about constraints: "Are there reasons for this approach?"
- Check for comments explaining unusual choices
- Consider that the author might have context you don't
- Be humble: "I might be missing context, but..."

**Principle**: Understand the "why" before critiquing the "how."

### 7.4 Missing the Forest for the Trees

**The Problem**: Getting lost in details and missing big-picture issues.

**Symptoms**:
- Many comments on naming and style
- Few or no comments on architecture or design
- Missing security or correctness issues
- Not considering how this fits into the system

**How to Avoid**:
- Start with high-level review: Does the overall approach make sense?
- Then review critical paths: Security, correctness, edge cases
- Finally review details: Naming, style, polish
- Step back periodically: "What's the big picture here?"

**Technique**: Review in passes—first pass for architecture/design, second for implementation, third for polish.

### 7.5 Inconsistent Standards

**The Problem**: Applying different standards to different changes or different authors.

**Why It's Harmful**:
- Erodes trust in the review process
- Can reflect or create bias
- Confuses team about expectations
- Damages team dynamics

**How to Avoid**:
- Use checklists for consistency
- Reference documented standards
- Be aware of potential biases (experience level, familiarity, etc.)
- Apply the same rigor regardless of author

**Microsoft Best Practice**: "Address bias—actively work against unconscious prejudice in evaluations."

### 7.6 Demanding Perfection

**The Problem**: Flagging too many minor issues that make the code seem inadequate.

**Why It's Harmful**:
- Discourages improvement ("why bother if it'll never be good enough?")
- Obscures the truly important issues
- Ignores the principle of continuous improvement
- Can demoralize the team

**How to Avoid**:
- Remember: "There is no such thing as perfect code"
- Ask: "Does this change make the codebase better?"
- Distinguish: Must-fix vs. could-be-better
- Use severity levels appropriately

**Guideline**: Focus feedback on issues that matter, not perfection.

### 7.7 Failing to Explain Rationale

**The Problem**: Pointing out issues without explaining why they matter.

**Example**:
```
Bad: "Don't use this pattern here."
Good: "This pattern can cause memory leaks when [scenario] because [reason].
      Consider using [alternative] which handles cleanup automatically."
```

**Why It's Harmful**:
- Misses learning opportunity
- Can feel arbitrary or authoritarian
- Doesn't help author make better decisions in future
- May cause confusion or pushback

**Microsoft Best Practice**: "Explain rationale—help authors understand your perspective."

### 7.8 Unconscious Bias

**The Problem**: Applying different standards based on author characteristics (experience, familiarity, etc.).

**Common Manifestations**:
- More scrutiny for junior developers
- Less scrutiny for senior developers
- Harsher tone with some team members
- More benefit-of-doubt for some authors

**How to Address**:
- Be aware that bias exists and affects everyone
- Use checklists to enforce consistent standards
- Review your own comments for tone differences
- Focus on the code, not who wrote it

**Microsoft Best Practice**: "Address bias—actively work against unconscious prejudice in evaluations."

## 8. Research-Backed Insights

### 8.1 Primary Outcomes of Code Review

**Microsoft Research Finding**: While finding defects is the top motivating factor for code reviews, the highest actual contribution is code improvement and knowledge sharing.

**Implication**: Don't focus exclusively on finding bugs. Pay equal or more attention to:
- Code quality and maintainability
- Knowledge transfer opportunities
- Consistency with codebase patterns
- Teaching and learning

---

## 9. Context-Specific Guidance

Different types of changes require different review approaches. Adjust your focus based on the change type.

### 9.1 Greenfield Code (New Features)

**Focus Areas**:
- **Design & Architecture**: Does this fit well with existing system?
- **API Design**: Is the interface intuitive and well-designed?
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage is critical for new code
- **Documentation**: New features should be documented
- **Future Extensibility**: Will this design allow for future needs?

**Questions to Ask**:
- Does this design make sense for the long term?
- Are the abstractions at the right level?
- Is the API consistent with existing patterns?
- Will other developers understand how to use/extend this?

**Higher Bar**: Greenfield code sets patterns for future work, so requires thorough review of design.

**Google Guideline**: "Requires design alignment, comprehensive testing, and documentation."

### 9.2 Bug Fixes

**Focus Areas**:
- **Root Cause**: Does the fix address the root cause or just symptoms?
- **Correctness**: Does the fix actually solve the problem?
- **Regressions**: Could this fix break something else?
- **Test Coverage**: Is there a test to prevent regression?
- **Scope**: Is the fix focused, or does it include unrelated changes?

**Questions to Ask**:
- Why did this bug occur in the first place?
- Does the fix address the underlying issue?
- Is there a test that would have caught this bug?
- Could this fix have unintended side effects?

**Guideline**: Bug fixes "should focus solely on the specific issue without scope expansion."

**Red Flag**: If a bug fix includes significant refactoring or feature work, suggest splitting it into separate changes.

### 9.3 Refactoring

**Focus Areas**:
- **Behavior Preservation**: Does behavior remain exactly the same?
- **Improvement**: Does this actually improve code quality?
- **Tests**: Do tests still pass? Do they verify behavior preservation?
- **Scope**: Is the refactoring focused and manageable?
- **Value**: Is the improvement worth the risk of changes?

**Questions to Ask**:
- Are there tests proving behavior is preserved?
- Is this refactoring making the code better?
- Is the scope appropriate (not too large)?
- Are there any subtle behavior changes?

**Best Practice**: Refactoring should be separate from behavior changes. Don't mix refactoring with features or fixes.

**Risk Management**: Large refactorings carry more risk. Ensure test coverage is strong.

### 9.4 Large-Scale Changes (Automated/Mechanical)

**Examples**: Renaming, moving files, updating dependencies, mass formatting changes.

**Focus Areas**:
- **Mechanical Correctness**: Was the transformation done correctly?
- **Completeness**: Were all instances updated?
- **Breakage**: Does everything still work?
- **Test Coverage**: Do tests still pass?

**Review Approach**:
- Can often be reviewed more lightly than hand-written changes
- Focus on spot-checking correctness
- Verify tests pass
- Check for edge cases the automation might have missed

**Google Guideline**: "Machine-generated modifications follow streamlined approval for low-risk updates."

**Questions to Ask**:
- Was this done with an automated tool?
- Are there edge cases that need manual review?
- Do all tests still pass?

### 9.5 Performance Optimizations

**Focus Areas**:
- **Benchmarks**: Are there measurements showing the improvement?
- **Correctness**: Does the optimization preserve correct behavior?
- **Readability**: Is the code still maintainable?
- **Actual Need**: Is this optimization actually needed?
- **Profiling**: Was the performance problem identified with profiling?

**Questions to Ask**:
- What measurements show this is a real performance problem?
- What measurements show the optimization helps?
- Does the optimization make the code harder to maintain?
- Are we optimizing the right thing?

**Red Flags**:
- Premature optimization without profiling
- Sacrificing readability for minimal gain
- Optimizing non-bottleneck code
- Missing benchmarks or measurements

**Guideline**: "Code itself is a liability"—avoid premature optimization that adds complexity.

### 9.6 Security-Critical Changes

**Focus Areas**:
- **Security Review**: Rigorous evaluation of security implications
- **Input Validation**: All inputs validated and sanitized
- **Authentication/Authorization**: Access controls correct
- **Data Protection**: Sensitive data protected
- **Known Vulnerabilities**: No use of vulnerable patterns

**Questions to Ask**:
- What happens if an attacker provides malicious input?
- Are all access control checks in place?
- Is sensitive data properly protected?
- Have we checked for common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)?

**Approach**:
- Take extra care on security-critical changes
- Consider suggesting security specialist review
- Flag security issues as Critical
- Ask questions even if they seem basic

**Guideline**: Security issues should almost always be flagged as Critical.

### 9.7 Documentation Updates

**Focus Areas**:
- **Accuracy**: Is the documentation correct?
- **Completeness**: Does it cover what it should?
- **Clarity**: Will users understand it?
- **Formatting**: Is it properly formatted and readable?

**Review Approach**:
- Generally lighter weight than code reviews
- Focus on accuracy and clarity
- Check links and examples work
- Verify consistency with code

**Lower Risk**: Documentation changes rarely break things, so can be reviewed more quickly.

### 9.8 Test-Only Changes

**Focus Areas**:
- **Test Quality**: Are these good tests?
- **Coverage**: Do they cover important cases?
- **Maintainability**: Are tests clear and maintainable?
- **Value**: Do these tests add value?

**Questions to Ask**:
- What behavior are these tests verifying?
- Are these tests brittle or robust?
- Do these tests add confidence?

**Benefit**: Test-only changes are lower risk and can often be reviewed quickly.

## 10. Quick Reference Checklist

### Essential Questions to Ask

**Correctness**:
- [ ] Does the code do what it's supposed to do?
- [ ] Are edge cases handled?
- [ ] Could this cause bugs or break existing functionality?

**Security**:
- [ ] Is user input validated?
- [ ] Are access controls correct?
- [ ] Is sensitive data protected?
- [ ] Are there injection vulnerabilities?

**Testing**:
- [ ] Are there tests for this change?
- [ ] Do tests cover important cases?
- [ ] Will tests catch regressions?

**Design**:
- [ ] Is the design appropriate for the system?
- [ ] Could this be simpler?
- [ ] Will this be maintainable?

**Clarity**:
- [ ] Will other developers understand this code?
- [ ] Are names clear and consistent?
- [ ] Is complex logic explained?

### Issue Severity Classification

**Critical** (must fix):
- [ ] Security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Correctness bugs
- [ ] Missing critical error handling
- [ ] Data integrity violations
- [ ] Breaking changes without migration plan

**Important** (should fix):
- [ ] Major complexity without justification
- [ ] Missing tests for risky code
- [ ] Architectural violations
- [ ] Significant technical debt introduction

**Minor** (could improve):
- [ ] Style inconsistencies
- [ ] Naming improvements
- [ ] Documentation gaps
- [ ] Minor code clarity issues

**Nits** (optional):
- [ ] Personal style preferences
- [ ] Alternative approaches (equally valid)
- [ ] Educational suggestions

### Signs of Quality (Call These Out Positively)

- [ ] Small, focused change
- [ ] Clear improvement to codebase health
- [ ] Good test coverage
- [ ] Clear, understandable code
- [ ] Follows established patterns
- [ ] Handles errors appropriately
- [ ] Well-named variables and functions
- [ ] Documented where needed

### Issue Prioritization Framework

```
For each potential issue, ask:

1. Does this affect correctness, security, or data integrity?
   YES → Critical
   NO → Continue

2. Does this significantly impact maintainability or architecture?
   YES → Important
   NO → Continue

3. Does this affect code quality in a meaningful way?
   YES → Minor
   NO → Continue

4. Is this a suggestion or personal preference?
   YES → Nit
```

### Review Output Structure

Structure your feedback as:

1. **Summary**: Overall assessment (e.g., "This is a solid implementation with good test coverage. I have a few suggestions for improvement.")

2. **Critical Issues**: List any critical issues first
   - Each with clear explanation and suggested fix

3. **Important Issues**: Follow with important issues
   - Each with rationale and suggestions

4. **Minor Issues**: Then minor improvements
   - Grouped by category if many

5. **Nits/Suggestions**: Optional improvements
   - Clearly marked as non-blocking

6. **Positive Feedback**: Call out good practices
   - Specific examples of what's done well

### Key Principles Recap

1. **Continuous improvement over perfection** - Focus on meaningful improvements
2. **Technical facts over opinions** - Ground feedback in principles, not preferences
3. **Focus on code, not author** - Critique the work, not the person
4. **Be humble and respectful** - You might be missing context
5. **Explain the why** - Help the author understand reasoning
6. **Prioritize by severity** - Critical issues first, nits last
7. **Security and correctness first** - These are always high priority
8. **Use clear severity labels** - Critical, Important, Minor, Nit
9. **Foster learning** - Reviews are teaching opportunities
10. **Be consistent** - Apply same standards regardless of context

## Summary

Your role as a code reviewer is to provide **expert, constructive feedback** that helps improve code quality. You are a consultant, not a gatekeeper.

**Remember**:
- There is no perfect code, only better code
- Identify real issues, not just differences from your preferences
- Focus on what matters: security, correctness, maintainability
- Communicate with respect, humility, and clarity
- Be consistent, fair, and constructive
- Balance criticism with recognition of good work

**The ultimate goal**: Help build a sustainable, high-quality codebase while fostering a culture of learning and continuous improvement.
