# Coverage Progress Summary — 2025-10-19

## Progress To Date
- Exercised additional scan-directory failure permutations (`test_scan_directory_max_depth_with_failures`, `test_scan_directory_ignore_list_retains_siblings`, `test_scan_directory_deep_alternating_failures`, `test_scan_directory_failure_counter_accumulates`) to cover max-depth warnings, ignore handling, and deeper alternating error trees, while confirming sibling stats remain intact.
- Expanded Velocity, Mustache, and HCL fixture suites so inline and multiline block closures with trailing whitespace, chained comment sequences, and dispatcher regressions for `.tfvars.json` suffix variants now hit their respective parser branches.
- Maintained the verification cadence (`cargo fmt`, `cargo test`, `cargo llvm-cov --workspace --summary-only --show-missing-lines`) after each batch; the latest run reports Regions 74.89 %, Lines 95.27 %, Functions 93.88 %.

## Outstanding Gaps
- `count_velocity_lines` still shows the `after_trimmed.is_empty()` branch uncovered (see `src/main.rs:1388-1391`); need a same-line `#* … *#` fixture that leaves only whitespace.
- Scan-directory error aggregation around `src/main.rs:3337-3370` lacks coverage for failure counts exceeding four and for deeper alternating success/failure chains near `src/main.rs:3683-3690`.
- Dispatcher coverage should confirm additional compound `.tfvars` variants (e.g., mixed-case with multiple suffixes) behave as expected.

## Next Steps
1. Craft targeted Velocity templates that isolate the whitespace-only block closure path and assert the expected counted lines.
2. Build multi-level sentinel directory fixtures that push failure counters beyond the current max and exercise the aggregation branches at `src/main.rs:3337-3370`, then re-run the verification suite.
3. Extend dispatcher regression tests to include double-suffixed mixed-case `.tfvars` patterns and document the resulting coverage deltas in `docs/coverage-summary-2025-10-19.md`.
