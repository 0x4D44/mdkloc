# Journal – Post Review Fixes
Date: 2025-11-18

## Entry 1 – Plan
- Fix role metrics drift: record role counts after normalization to align summaries with reported stats.
- Adjust `testdata` heuristic: scope it to Rust-only to avoid over-classifying fixtures when future languages gain role support.
- Clarify Role Summary to distinguish per-role file occurrences vs unique files (optional message when multi-role files exist).

## Entry 2 – Implemented fixes
- Role metrics now record normalized line totals, preventing drift between Role Summary and reported tables (`process_file` path).
- `testdata` heuristic is scoped to Rust files only, reducing future over-classification when other languages gain role support.
- Role Summary wording now clarifies per-role file occurrences; adds a note when totals can exceed unique files.
- Validation: `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`, `cargo test` all pass.

## Entry 3 – Coverage check after fixes
- Ran `cargo llvm-cov --summary-only --ignore-filename-regex 'src/tests_included.rs$'`.
- Result: `src/main.rs` 98.67% lines (32 missed), 95.59% regions. Target (≥98% lines) still met.
